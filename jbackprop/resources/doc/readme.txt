- Overview
---------------------------------------------

What is JBackprop?

JBackprop supports multi-layer perceptron neural networks
which are trained using the back-propagation learning 
algorithm.  

It contains two executables:

  1. jbackprop.jar:  can be run using JDK 1.3 or greater,
  2. jbackprop.exe:  windows executable built using the gcj
     compiler for java. 

What can you do with JBackprop?

JBackprop is a tool for solving problems.  Using JBackprop,
you can create, test, train, and apply neural networks 
to solve any of these types of problems:

  1. Recognizing patterns and trends in numeric data, 
  2. Recognizing the difference between several types of images 
     or patterns, 
  3. Predicting the outcome of random events such as horse races, 
     soccer game scores, or the stock market, 
  4. Creating approximation fuctions. 

How do I install JBackprop?

Unzip the release into a directory.  

---------------------------------------------
- Running
---------------------------------------------

Run jbackprop using the command jbackprop.exe for
the executable or "java -jar jbackprop.jar" for
the jar file.  This will display the help screen.

The normal commands for running jbackprop to solve
the xor problem are

   jbackprop.exe -p xor.trn xor.xml

or 

   java -jar jbackprop.jar -p xor.trn xor.xml

- Building (source available upon request)
---------------------------------------------

There are two options for building jbackprop.

OPTION - 1, GCJ Compiler

   Steps:
   1. Type make to build jbackprop.

OPTION - 2, Build jbackprop.jar

   Steps:
   1. Make sure you have ant installed.
   2. Type the command, ant make jar.
